If Chess is a science, it's a most inexact one. If Chess is an art, it is too exacting to be seen as one. If Chess is a sport, it's too esoteric. If Chess is a game, it's too demanding to be just a game. If Chess is a mistress, she's a demanding one. If Chess is a passion, it's a rewarding one. If Chess is life, it's a sad one.

No other master has such a terrific will to win. At the board he radiates danger, and even the strongest opponents tend to freeze, like rabbits when they smell a panther. Even his weaknesses are dangerous. As white, his opening game is predictable - you can make plans against it - but so strong that your plans almost never work. In the middle game his precision and invention are fabulous, and in the end game you simply cannot beat him.

If I'm thinking for more than 20 minutes about one move, it's usually a waste.

I go over many games collections and pick up something from the style of each player.

I have always thought it a matter of honour for every chess player to deserve the smile of fortune.

In one game it is too difficult to play both for win and draw simultaneously.

It is difficult to play against Einstein's theory.
	 -- on his first loss to Fischer (Mikhail Tal)

Later, I began to succeed in decisive games. Perhaps because I realized a very simple truth: not only was I worried, but also my opponent.
	 (Mikhail Tal)
%
Many Chess players were surprised when after the game, Fischer quietly explained: 'I had already analyzed this possibility' in a position which I thought was not possible to foresee from the opening.
	 (Mikhail Tal)
%
Naturally, the psychological susceptibility of a match participant is significantly higher than a participant in a tournament, since each game substantially changes the over-all position.

Petrosian-Spassky? To think I could have watched an excellent football match instead!

Some sacrifices are sound; the rest are mine.
	 (Mikhail Tal)

There are two types of sacrifices: correct ones and mine.

To play for a draw, at any rate with white, is to some degree a crime against chess.
	 (Mikhail Tal)

We will note the openings used by the participants of a nine-round match. The age of openings is considerably higher than the age of both rivals. Some opening positions could be analyzed by Steinitz when he was preparing to his match with Zukertort.

When I asked Fischer why he had not played a certain move in our game, he replied: 'Well, you laughed when I wrote it down!'

When one of us first plays chess, he is like a man who has already caught a dose of microbes...Such a man walks along the street, and he does not yet know that he is ill. He is healthy, he feels fine, but the microbes are doing their work.

You must take your opponent into a deep dark forest where 2+2=5, and the path leading out is only wide enough for one.

I guess a certain amount of temperament is expected of Chess geniuses.

I love all positions. Give me a difficult positional game, I will play it. But totally won positions, I cannot stand them.
	 (Hein Donner)

I played Chess with him and would have beaten him sometimes only he always took back his last move, and ran the game out differently.

I'm not a materialistic person, in that, I don't suffer the lack or loss of money. The absence of worldly goods I don't look back on. For Chess is a way I can be as materialistic as I want without having to sell my soul.

These are not pieces, they are men! For any man to walk into the line of fire will be one less man in your army to fight for you. Value every troop and use him wisely, throw him not to the dogs as he is there to serve his King.

If we compare Carlsen with Anand or me or someone else, by ten criteria, he will be stronger in eight of them.

There was a moment at the beginning when the machines were a positive, but lately we've being passing to the other extreme. Now it seems that a move isn't good unless the machine says so.

If you want everyone to believe that you really did play a fantastic combination, be sure to play it in a tournament game.

Knowing which pieces you want exchanged is a great help in finding the right moves.
	 (Graham Burgess)

Really deep opening research has been a hallmark of [Garry] Kasparov's domination of world chess. He does not just try to find new moves, but whole new plans and strategies.

In Fischer's hands, a slight theoretical advantage is as good a being a Queen ahead.

In a gambit you give up a Pawn for the sake of getting a lost game.

In complicated positions, Bobby Fischer hardly had to be afraid of anybody.

It was impossible to win against Capablanca; against [Alexander] Alekhine it was impossible to play.

The older I grow, the more I value Pawns.
	 (Paul Keres)

In life, as in Chess, ones own Pawns block ones way. A mans very wealth, ease, leisure, children, books, which should help him to win, more often checkmate him.

In the perfect Chess combination as in a first-rate short story, the whole plot and counter-plot should lead up to a striking finale, the interest not being allayed until the very last moment.

It began to feel as though you were playing against Chess itself.

It doesn't matter how strong a player you are, if you fail to register some development in the opening, then you are asking for trouble.

It is no easy matter to reply correctly to [Emanuel] Lasker's bad moves.

It is not possible to become a great player without having learned how to analyse deeply and accurately.
	 (Mark Dvoretsky)

It was clear to me that the vulnerable point of the American Grandmaster [Bobby Fischer] was in double-edged, hanging, irrational positions, where he often failed to find a win even in a won position.

It's a shame to be the face of chess and to play chess badly.

Look at Garry Kasparov. After he loses, invariably he wins the next game. He just kills the next guy. That's something that we have to learn to be able to do.

Marriage is like a game of chess except the board is flowing water, the pieces are made of smoke and no move you make will have any effect on the outcome.

My style is somewhere between that of Tal and Petrosian.

The knight is renowned for, among other things, its suitability as a blockader. Because its strength lies in short-range operations it is not uncomfortable standing in a single spot for long periods, as the Bishop is.

Nonsense was the last thing Fischer was interested in, as far as Chess was concerned.

Of Chess it has been said that life is not long enough for it, but that is the fault of life, not Chess.

Once there is the slightest suggestion of combinational possibilities on the board, look for unusual moves. Apart from making your play creative and interesting, it will help you get better results.

Only a severe self-critical outlook will help a player to assess his strong and weak points and so further the process of improving his play.

The chessboard is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the Universe, the rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature and the player on the other side is hidden from us.
	 (Thomas Huxley)

The most important feature of the Chess position is the activity of the pieces. This is absolutely fundamental in all phases of the game: Opening, Middlegame and especially Endgame. The primary constraint on a piece's activity is the Pawn structure.

Via the squares on the chessboard, the Indians explain the movement of time and the age, the higher influences which control the world and the ties which link Chess with the human soul.

Vishy Anand is the most versatile world chess champion. After all, he won world championships in classical matches, knockouts, rapids and blitz and dominated the advanced chess in which players are able to consult the computers.

A Chess game is a dialogue, a conversation between a player and his opponent. Each move by the opponent may contain threats or be a blunder, but a player cannot defend against threats or take advantage of blunders if he does not first ask himself: What is my opponent planning after each move?
	 (Bruce A. Moon)

Adequate compensation for a sacrifice is having a sound combination leading to a winning position; adequate compensation for a blunder is having your opponent snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

Good offense and good defense both begin with good development.
