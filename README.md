# chesscookies

A collection of files with cookies for the linux fortune program

# Files

## Text file:

* `theme_cookies` , where _theme_ is some word to describe the theme of the cookies. 

This is a list of quotes, separated by a line with a single percentage symbol `%`

## Data file:

* `theme_cookies.dat`, this is the correspondent _data string_ file generated by the _makefile_.

# Install

* make cookies

Creates chesscookies.dat from the text file chesscookies

* sudo make install

Copy the files chesscookies and chesscookies.dat to your /usr/share/games/fortunes

(The directory must exists. The fortune program must be installed on the system)

# Uninstall

During the installation, both files are copied to `/usr/share/games/fortunes`. As simples as that.

To uninstall, just type:

* `make uninstall`

or you can also safely manually remove the pair of files you want (`theme_cookies` and `theme_cookies.dat`).
